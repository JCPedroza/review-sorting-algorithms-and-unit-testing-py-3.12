# Implementing & Testing Sorting Algorithms Using Python 3.12 New Features

This project is a quick review of:
  * Python 3.12 new features
  * Python native unit testing with the `unittest` module
  * Sorting algorithms

## Installation

Installation is only needed for static type check and formatting. Note that
`mypy` might not yet support type aliases.

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Unit Testing

This project uses the `unittest` native Python module to write and run unit
testing.

To run tests use either:

```bash
python sort_test.py
python -m unittest sort_test.py
```
